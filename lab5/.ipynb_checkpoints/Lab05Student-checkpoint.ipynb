    "**Problem 5a (Simple queue model).** Consider the following process: There is a queue that can hold up to $N$ people. At each timestep a person arrives with probability $p_a$, and then a person is served and leaves with probability $p_d$. If there are $N$ people in the queue, no new person arrives. Similarly, if there are no people in the queue, no person leaves. Write a function that, given $N$, $p_a$ and $p_d$ generates a **numpy** array representing the transition matrix of the corresponding Markov chain. Recall that the transition matrix $M$ has $M_{s,t}$ equal to the probability of going from state $s$ to state $t$ in a single step.\n",
