    "**Problem 1a.** During exercise session, we showed that for $d$ equally likely dates in a year and $n$ people, the probability of a repeat date is $p(n)=1-\\frac{d^\\underline{n}}{d^n}$. We also derived a simple approximate formula for this probability: $p_a(n) = 1-e^{-\\frac{n(n-1)}{2d}}$. In particular, this approximation implies that for $d=365$ dates, $p(n)$ is close to $\\frac{1}{2}$ for $n=23$.\n",
